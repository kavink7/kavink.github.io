I am a final year undergraduate in Mechanical Engineering at the National Institute of Technology Karnataka, Surathkal.
My research interests are - fluid mechanics, heat transfer, experimental fluid mechanics, microfluidics, turbulence and machine learning.
Currently, I work on two problems - wake dynamics of mixed convective flows past square cylinders and data-driven solutions of the Navier-Stokes equations using physics-informed neural networks.

Experience
======
I have considerable experience as a research assistant in various roles in academia in my undergraduate time. A detailed account of my experience may be found in my CV page above.
