permalink: /publication/2015-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'In the present work, electrohydrodynamic
(EHD) flow in a channel has been analyzed using
finite volume method to solve for the flow field
using an in-house code developed in FORTRAN.
Flow field has been estimated using an assumed
distribution of electrical field variables such as space
charge density, electric potential and electric field.
Various regimes of flow have been analyzed by
considering variation of the characteristic
dimensionless numbers for flow (Re – Reynolds
number) and electric field (EHD –
electrohydrodynamic number). It is found that the
dynamics of such systems follow that of mixed
convection systems, with two forces of opposing
effects and their relative strength deciding the final
flow patterns. At high Reynolds numbers, the flow
is unmodified compared to normal fluid flow in a
channel. As the Reynolds number is reduced, the
electric field begins to modify the flow field.
