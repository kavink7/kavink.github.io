excerpt: 'Although many research works based on the thermohydraulic properties of porous media are present, a comparison of metal foams and wire meshes vis-Ã -vis heat transfer has not been performed. In this study, an investigation into metal foams and wire meshes has been performed with respect to their thermal and hydraulic behaviour. A vertical channel setup containing the porous media and a heated metal plate at the centre, undergoing air forced convection flow has been considered. The metal plate is supplied with a constant heat flux and the thermal performance of the porous media has been evaluated. The problem phenomena have been computationally modelled using Darcy-extended-Forchheimer flow model and Local Thermal Non-Equilibrium (LTNE) model. It has been observed in this study, that from the perspective of thermal performance, wire mesh serves better whereas in hydraulic performance, the metal foam is a better choice.'
